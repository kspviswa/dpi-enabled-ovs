The physical switch or switches managed by the VTEP.
.IP
When a physical switch integrates support for this VTEP schema, which
is expected to be the most common case, this column should point to one
\fBPhysical_Switch\fR record that represents the switch
itself.  In another possible implementation, a server or a VM presents
a VTEP schema front-end interface to one or more physical switches,
presumably communicating with those physical switches over a
proprietary protocol.  In that case, this column would point to one
\fBPhysical_Switch\fR for each physical switch, and the set
might change over time as the front-end server comes to represent a
differing set of switches.
.ST "Database Configuration:"
These columns primarily configure the database server
(\fBovsdb\-server\fR), not the hardware VTEP itself.
.IP "\fBmanagers\fR: set of \fBManager\fRs"

Tunnel end-point remote to the physical switch.
.ST "Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD):"
BFD, defined in RFC 5880, allows point to point detection of
connectivity failures by occasional transmission of BFD control
messages. VTEPs are expected to implement BFD.
.PP
BFD operates by regularly transmitting BFD control messages at a
rate negotiated independently in each direction.  Each endpoint
specifies the rate at which it expects to receive control messages,
and the rate at which it\(cqs willing to transmit them.  An endpoint
which fails to receive BFD control messages for a period of three
times the expected reception rate will signal a connectivity
fault.  In the case of a unidirectional connectivity issue, the
system not receiving BFD control messages will signal the problem
to its peer in the messages it transmits.
.PP
A hardware VTEP is expected to use BFD to determine reachability of
devices at the end of the tunnels with which it exchanges data. This
can enable the VTEP to choose a functioning service node among a set of
service nodes providing high availability. It also enables the NVC to
report the health status of tunnels.
.PP
In most cases the BFD peer of a hardware VTEP will be an Open vSwitch
instance. The Open vSwitch implementation of BFD aims to comply
faithfully with the requirements put forth in RFC 5880.  Open vSwitch
does not implement the optional Authentication or ``Echo Mode\(cq\(cq
features.
.ST "BFD Local Configuration:"
The HSC writes the key-value pairs in the
\fBbfd_config_local\fR column to specifiy the local
configurations to be used for BFD sessions on this tunnel.
.IP "\fBbfd_config_local : bfd_dst_mac\fR: optional string"
Set to an Ethernet address in the form
\fIxx\fR:\fIxx\fR:\fIxx\fR:\fIxx\fR:\fIxx\fR:\fIxx\fR
to set the MAC expected as destination for received BFD packets.
The default is \fB00:23:20:00:00:01\fR\.
.IP "\fBbfd_config_local : bfd_dst_ip\fR: optional string"
Set to an IPv4 address to set the IP address that is expected as destination
for received BFD packets.  The default is \fB169.254.1.0\fR\.
.ST "BFD Remote Configuration:"
The \fBbfd_config_remote\fR column is the remote
counterpart of the \fBbfd_config_local\fR column.
The NVC writes the key-value pairs in this column.
.IP "\fBbfd_config_remote : bfd_dst_mac\fR: optional string"
Set to an Ethernet address in the form
\fIxx\fR:\fIxx\fR:\fIxx\fR:\fIxx\fR:\fIxx\fR:\fIxx\fR
to set the destination MAC to be used for transmitted BFD packets.
The default is \fB00:23:20:00:00:01\fR\.
.IP "\fBbfd_config_remote : bfd_dst_ip\fR: optional string"
Set to an IPv4 address to set the IP address used as destination
for transmitted BFD packets.  The default is \fB169.254.1.1\fR\.
.ST "BFD Parameters:"
The NVC sets up key-value pairs in the \fBbfd_params\fR
column to enable and configure BFD.
.IP "\fBbfd_params : enable\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
True to enable BFD on this tunnel.
The default is False.
.IP "\fBbfd_params : min_rx\fR: optional string, containing an integer, at least 1"
The shortest interval, in milliseconds, at which this BFD session
offers to receive BFD control messages.  The remote endpoint may
choose to send messages at a slower rate.  Defaults to
\fB1000\fR\.
.IP "\fBbfd_params : min_tx\fR: optional string, containing an integer, at least 1"
The shortest interval, in milliseconds, at which this BFD session is
willing to transmit BFD control messages.  Messages will actually be
transmitted at a slower rate if the remote endpoint is not willing to
receive as quickly as specified.  Defaults to \fB100\fR\.
.IP "\fBbfd_params : decay_min_rx\fR: optional string, containing an integer"
An alternate receive interval, in milliseconds, that must be greater
than or equal to \fBbfd:min_rx\fR\.  The
implementation switches from \fBbfd:min_rx\fR to \fBbfd:decay_min_rx\fR when there is no obvious incoming
data traffic at the interface, to reduce the CPU and bandwidth cost
of monitoring an idle interface.  This feature may be disabled by
setting a value of 0.  This feature is reset whenever \fBbfd:decay_min_rx\fR or \fBbfd:min_rx\fR
changes.
.IP "\fBbfd_params : forwarding_if_rx\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
True to consider the interface capable of packet I/O as long as it
continues to receive any packets (not just BFD packets).  This
prevents link congestion that causes consecutive BFD control packets
to be lost from marking the interface down.
.IP "\fBbfd_params : cpath_down\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
Set to true to notify the remote endpoint that traffic should not be
forwarded to this system for some reason other than a connectivty
failure on the interface being monitored.  The typical underlying
reason is ``concatenated path down,\(cq\(cq that is, that connectivity
beyond the local system is down.  Defaults to false.
.IP "\fBbfd_params : check_tnl_key\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
Set to true to make BFD accept only control messages with a tunnel
key of zero.  By default, BFD accepts control messages with any
tunnel key.
.ST "BFD Status:"
The VTEP sets key-value pairs in the \fBbfd_status\fR
column to report the status of BFD on this tunnel.  When BFD is
not enabled, with \fBbfd_params:enable\fR, the
HSC clears all key-value pairs from \fBbfd_status\fR\.
.IP "\fBbfd_status : enabled\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
Set to true if the BFD session has been successfully
enabled. Set to false if the VTEP cannot support BFD or has
insufficient resources to enable BFD on this tunnel. The NVC
will disable the BFD monitoring on the other side of the tunnel
once this value is set to false.
.IP "\fBbfd_status : state\fR: optional string, one of \fBdown\fR, \fBinit\fR, \fBup\fR, or \fBadmin_down\fR"
Reports the state of the BFD session.  The BFD session is fully
healthy and negotiated if \fBUP\fR\.
.IP "\fBbfd_status : forwarding\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
Reports whether the BFD session believes this tunnel
may be used to forward traffic.  Typically this means the local session
is signaling \fBUP\fR, and the remote system isn\(cqt signaling a
problem such as concatenated path down.
.IP "\fBbfd_status : diagnostic\fR: optional string"
In case of a problem, set to an error message that reports what the
local BFD session thinks is wrong.  The error messages are defined
in section 4.1 of [RFC 5880].
.IP "\fBbfd_status : remote_state\fR: optional string, one of \fBdown\fR, \fBinit\fR, \fBup\fR, or \fBadmin_down\fR"

In case of a problem, set to an error message that reports what the
remote endpoint\(cqs BFD session thinks is wrong.  The error messages
are defined in section 4.1 of [RFC 5880].

.ST "Per Logical-Switch Tunnel Key:"
Tunnel protocols tend to have a field that allows the tunnel
to be partitioned into sub-tunnels: VXLAN has a VNI, GRE and
STT have a key, CAPWAP has a WSI, and so on.  We call these
generically ``tunnel keys.\(cq\(cq  Given that one needs to use a
tunnel key at all, there are at least two reasonable ways to
assign their values:
.RS
.IP \(bu
Per \fBLogical_Switch\fR+\fBPhysical_Locator\fR
pair.  That is, each logical switch may be assigned a different
tunnel key on every \fBPhysical_Locator\fR\.  This model is
especially flexible.
.IP
In this model, \fBPhysical_Locator\fR carries the tunnel
key.  Therefore, one \fBPhysical_Locator\fR record will
exist for each logical switch carried at a given IP destination.
.IP \(bu
Per \fBLogical_Switch\fR\.  That is, every tunnel
associated with a particular logical switch carries the same tunnel
key, regardless of the \fBPhysical_Locator\fR to which the
tunnel is addressed.  This model may ease switch implementation
because it imposes fewer requirements on the hardware datapath.
.IP
In this model, \fBLogical_Switch\fR carries the tunnel
key.  Therefore, one \fBPhysical_Locator\fR record will
exist for each IP destination.
.RE
.IP "\fBtunnel_key\fR: optional integer"
This column is used only in the tunnel key per \fBLogical_Switch\fR model (see above), because only in that
model is there a tunnel key associated with a logical switch.

length, both the router\(cqs interface address and the subnet

MAC address to be used when a VTEP issues ARP requests on behalf

A distributed logical router is implemented by a set of VTEPs
(both hardware VTEPs and vswitches). In order for a given VTEP
to populate the local ARP cache for a logical router, it issues
ARP requests with a source MAC address that is unique to the VTEP. A
single per-VTEP MAC can be re-used across all logical
networks. This table contains the MACs that are used by the
VTEPs of a given HSC. The table provides the mapping from MAC to
physical locator for each VTEP so that replies to the ARP
requests can be sent back to the correct VTEP using the
appropriate physical locator.
